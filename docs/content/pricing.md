### License

::::accordion
  :::::accordion-item{label="Do I need a license for each project I work on?" icon="i-lucide-circle-help"}
  One license, unlimited projects. With Styleframe Pro, you can build as many sites as you want without purchasing additional licenses.
  
  Use it for all your client work, personal projects, and SaaS applications — as long as they comply with our license terms. No per-project fees, no hidden costs.
  
  [Read our license](/license) for full details and examples.
  :::::
  :::::accordion-item{label="Can I use styleframe Pro for client projects?" icon="i-lucide-circle-help"}
  Yes! Styleframe Pro is perfect for client work:
  
  - **Single client projects**: Use your license to build custom websites

  [Read our license](/license) for full details and examples.
  :::::
  :::::accordion-item{label="Can I use styleframe Pro for my own commercial projects?" icon="i-lucide-circle-help"}
  Absolutely! Your license covers unlimited projects — from public websites to paid SaaS applications.
  
  The only restriction: you can't create website builders or tools that let users generate their own sites using Styleframe Pro components. Please contact [support@styleframe.com](mailto:support@styleframe.com) for more information about a Builder License. Everything else is fair game.

  Yes, you can use styleframe Pro to create derivative products like themes, UI kits, page builders, or anything else where you would be repackaging and redistributing our components or templates for someone else to use to build their own sites, but this will require a special Builder License. Contact [support@styleframe.com](mailto:support@styleframe.com) for more information.
