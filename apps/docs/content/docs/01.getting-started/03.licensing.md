## Overview

Styleframe is offered under two licensing options to suit different needs:

- **Styleframe Community** (core library) is free and open source under the MIT License
- **Styleframe Pro** is free for development, requires a license for production
    - One Pro license covers unlimited personal and commercial projects

## Styleframe Community (MIT License)

The core Styleframe library is completely free and open source, licensed under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). This means you can:

- ✅ Use it for free in any project (personal or commercial)
- ✅ Modify and customize it however you want
- ✅ Distribute it freely
- ✅ Use it in open source or proprietary projects
- ✅ Sell products built with it
- ✅ No attribution required (though appreciated!)

**No strings attached.** The MIT License is one of the most permissive open source licenses available.

## Styleframe Pro (Commercial License)

Styleframe Pro extends the core library with premium features like fluid responsive design, advanced composables, and professional tooling. It requires a commercial license for production use.

### Development is Free - Try Before You Buy

Styleframe Pro is **completely free for development environments**. Test all premium features locally without a license key. No credit card required.

You can use Styleframe Pro free of charge in:
- ✅ **Local development** environments
- ✅ **Testing and staging** environments
- ✅ Any environment not accessible to end users

::note
**Note:** Development mode may display watermarks or console warnings to indicate unlicensed usage.
::

### Production Requires a License

To use Styleframe Pro in production (any environment accessible to end users or the general public), you need a valid license for each developer in your organization that uses Styleframe Pro.

#### What's Included in a License

- ✅ **Unlimited Projects** - Use on unlimited personal and commercial projects
- ✅ **Client Work** - Cover all your client websites and applications
- ✅ **Commercial Applications** - Build and sell SaaS products, themes, and tools
- ✅ **Team Collaboration** - Share with your team members
- ✅ **Updates & Support** - Access to minor and patch updates
- ✅ **Production Deployments** - Deploy to live, public-facing environments

#### One License, Unlimited Projects

Your Styleframe Pro license covers unlimited projects. Build as many websites, applications, and client projects as you want without purchasing additional licenses.

Activating your Styleframe Pro license is simple:

::steps
