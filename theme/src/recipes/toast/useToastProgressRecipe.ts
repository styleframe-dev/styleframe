/**
 * Toast progress recipe — a prominent duration indicator that reads as a
 * countdown at a glance. It scales from full width to zero over
 * `--toast-duration` (default 5s), mirroring the auto-dismiss countdown. Pure
 * CSS: the recipe owns the keyframes and reads the duration from a custom
 * property, so nothing has to flip a data-attribute at runtime — declarative
 * and driftless.
 *
 * The bar is pinned flush to the bottom edge and spans the full toast width —
 * `bottom`/`left`/`right: "0"` (the literal zero, the one non-token value the
 * inset utilities accept), edge-to-edge, no gutter. Its thickness stays a named
 * spacing token (`@spacing.2xs`) since `height` — unlike the inset utilities —
 * maps the scale cleanly. It is the second part (with the icon) that carries the
 * toast's `color` — the body stays neutral, so the accent lands here. `color`
 * sets the bar's foreground from the shared accent map, and `background:
 * currentColor` paints the bar in that accent at full opacity.
