/**
 * Drawer container recipe — an edge-anchored, slide-out overlay panel
 * (a Modal anchored to a screen edge). Supports color (light, dark, neutral),
 * variant, size, and `side` (top, right, bottom, left) axes.
 *
 * Positioning: the panel is `position: fixed` and anchors to one edge. Each
 * `side` pins the panel to that edge, caps its cross-axis at the viewport, and
 * raises the single border edge that faces the content; the shared surface
 * compounds then paint that edge.
 *
 * Sizing: left/right drawers span the full viewport height and take their width
 * from `size`; top/bottom drawers span the full width and take their height
 * from their content (capped at `100vh`). In every case the body fills the
 * space between the header and footer and scrolls when its content overflows,
 * while the header and footer keep their natural height (see the setup callback).
 *
 * The recipe is static: the consumer owns the open/close slide transition,
 * focus trap, and `Esc` handling — exactly like the Modal recipe.
