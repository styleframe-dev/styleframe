 * Toggle group recipe — a flex container that lays out multiple `.toggle` buttons
 * with spacing between them. Supports orientation (horizontal / vertical) and a
 * size axis that controls the gap between items. Mirrors `checkbox-group` /
 * `radio-group`, but defaults to `horizontal` since toggle groups read as
 * horizontal segmented controls.
 *
 * For the connected segmented look (toggles joined at the seams with no gap), wrap
 * the toggles in the `field-group` recipe instead — it already merges adjacent
 * border radii and inner borders on any bordered child.
