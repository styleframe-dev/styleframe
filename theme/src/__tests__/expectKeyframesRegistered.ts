/**
 * Assert that a `@keyframes <name>` at-rule was registered on the instance
 * root — i.e. a recipe's `setup()` callback actually called
 * `s.keyframes(name, …)`.
 *
 * Recipes reference keyframes indirectly, by a string `animationName` in their
 * base/variants. That string is opaque to the base/variant object assertions,
 * so if the matching `s.keyframes(...)` registration is deleted the animation
 * silently goes inert and nothing red catches it. This helper closes that
 * blind spot: any recipe that names an animation must prove the keyframes
 * behind it exist.
 *
 * Returns the matched at-rule so callers can further assert its steps.
